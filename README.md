# SwiftAgent

**Native Swift SDK for building autonomous AI agents with Apple's FoundationModels design philosophy**

SwiftAgent simplifies AI agent development by providing a clean, intuitive API that handles all the complexity of agent loops, tool execution, and provider communication. Inspired by Apple's FoundationModels framework, it brings the same elegant, declarative approach to cross-platform AI agent development.

**⚠️ Work in Progress**: SwiftAgent is currently an early prototype. The basic agent loop with tool calling is already working, but there's lots of things left to implement. APIs may change, and breaking updates are expected. Use in production with caution.

## ✨ Features

- **🎯 Zero-Setup Agent Loops** — Handle autonomous agent execution with just a few lines of code
- **🔧 Native Tool Integration** — Use `@Generable` structs from FoundationModels as agent tools seamlessly  
- **🌐 Provider Agnostic** — Abstract interface supports multiple AI providers (OpenAI included, more coming)
- **📱 Apple-Native Design** — API inspired by FoundationModels for familiar, intuitive development
- **🚀 Modern Swift** — Built with Swift 6, async/await, and latest concurrency features
- **📊 Rich Logging** — Comprehensive, human-readable logging for debugging and monitoring
- **🎛️ Flexible Configuration** — Fine-tune generation options, tools, and provider settings

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

Add SwiftAgent to your Swift project:

```swift
// Package.swift
dependencies: [
  .package(url: "https://github.com/SwiftedMind/SwiftAgent.git", branch: "main")
]
```

### Basic Usage

```swift
import SwiftAgent
import FoundationModels

// Configure your provider
let config = OpenAIProvider.Configuration.direct(apiKey: "your-api-key")
OpenAIProvider.Configuration.setDefaultConfiguration(config)

// Create an agent with tools
let agent = Agent<OpenAIProvider>(
  tools: [WeatherTool(), CalculatorTool()],
  instructions: "You are a helpful assistant."
)

// Run your agent
let response = try await agent.respond(
  to: "What's the weather like in San Francisco?",
  using: .gpt5
)

print(response.content)
```

---

## 🛠️ Building Tools

Create tools using Apple's `@Generable` macro for type-safe, schema-free tool definitions:

```swift
struct WeatherTool: AgentTool {
  let name = "get_weather"
  let description = "Get current weather for a location"
  
  @Generable
  struct Arguments {
    @Guide(description: "City name")
    let city: String
    
    @Guide(description: "Temperature unit", .oneOf(["celsius", "fahrenheit"]))
    let unit: String = "celsius"
  }
  
  @Generable
  struct Output {
    let temperature: Double
    let condition: String
    let humidity: Int
  }
  
  func call(arguments: Arguments) async throws -> Output {
    // Your weather API implementation
    return Output(
      temperature: 22.5,
      condition: "sunny",
      humidity: 65
    )
  }
}
```

---

## 📖 Advanced Usage

### Structured Output Generation

Generate structured data directly from agent responses:

```swift
@Generable
struct TaskList {
  let tasks: [Task]
  let priority: String
}

@Generable 
struct Task {
  let title: String
  let completed: Bool
}

let response = try await agent.respond(
  to: "Create a todo list for planning a vacation",
  generating: TaskList.self,
  using: .gpt5
)

// response.content is now a strongly-typed TaskList
for task in response.content.tasks {
  print("- \(task.title)")
}
```

### Custom Generation Options

```swift
let options = GenerationOptions(
  maxTokens: 1000,
  temperature: 0.7,
  allowedSteps: 10
)

let response = try await agent.respond(
  to: "Help me analyze this data",
  using: .gpt5,
  options: options
)
```

### Conversation History

Access full conversation transcripts:

```swift
// Continue conversations naturally
try await agent.respond(to: "What was my first question?")

// Access conversation history
for entry in agent.transcript.entries {
  switch entry {
  case .prompt(let prompt):
    print("User: \(prompt.content)")
  case .response(let response):
    print("Agent: \(response.content)")
  case .toolCalls(let calls):
    print("Tool calls: \(calls.calls.map(\.name))")
  // ... handle other entry types
  }
}
```

---

## 🔧 Configuration

### Provider Setup

```swift
// Direct API key
let config = OpenAIProvider.Configuration.direct(apiKey: "sk-...")

// Custom endpoint
let config = OpenAIProvider.Configuration.custom(
  apiKey: "sk-...",
  baseURL: URL(string: "https://api.custom-openai.com")!
)

OpenAIProvider.Configuration.setDefaultConfiguration(config)
```

### Logging

```swift
// Enable comprehensive logging
AgentConfiguration.setLoggingEnabled(true)

// Logs show:
// 🟢 Agent start — model=gpt-5 | tools=weather, calculator
// 🛠️ Tool call — weather [abc123]
// 📤 Tool output — weather [abc123]
// ✅ Finished
```
