	/// The session will be configured with a direct connection to OpenAI's API using the provided API key.
	///
	/// - Parameter tools: An array of tools the AI agent can use during conversations. Defaults to an empty array.
	/// - Parameter instructions: System instructions that define the AI's behavior and personality. Defaults to an empty
	/// string.
	/// - Parameter apiKey: Your OpenAI API key for authentication.
	/// - Returns: A configured ``OpenAISession`` ready for AI interactions.
	///
	/// Example:
	/// ```swift
	/// let session = ModelSession.openAI(
	///   tools: [WeatherTool(), CalculatorTool()],
	///   instructions: "You are a helpful assistant that can check weather and do calculations.",
	///   apiKey: "sk-your-api-key-here"

	/// Creates a simple OpenAI-powered ModelSession without context using a custom configuration.
	///
	/// This method allows you to create an OpenAI session with advanced configuration options,
	/// such as custom endpoints, models, or proxy settings. Use this when you need more control
	/// over the OpenAI connection than the basic API key method provides.
	///
	/// - Parameter tools: An array of tools the AI agent can use during conversations. Defaults to an empty array.
	/// - Parameter instructions: System instructions that define the AI's behavior and personality. Defaults to an empty

	/// - Parameter configuration: A custom ``OpenAIConfiguration`` that defines how to connect to OpenAI services.
	/// - Returns: A configured ``OpenAISession`` ready for AI interactions.
	///
	/// Example:
	/// ```swift
	/// let configuration = OpenAIConfiguration.direct(apiKey: "your-api-key")
	/// let session = ModelSession.openAI(

	/// Creates a contextual OpenAI-powered ModelSession with custom configuration.
	///
	/// This method creates an OpenAI session that supports context injection, allowing you to
	/// provide additional data to your prompts through a type that conforms to ``PromptContextSource``.
	/// This is useful for sophisticated AI interactions that require user data, preferences,
	/// or other contextual information to be available to the AI.
	///
	/// - Parameter tools: An array of tools the AI agent can use during conversations. Defaults to an empty array.
	/// - Parameter instructions: System instructions that define the AI's behavior and personality. Defaults to an empty
	/// string.
	/// - Parameter context: The type of context that will be injected into prompts. Must conform to
	/// `PromptContextSource`.
	/// - Parameter configuration: A custom ``OpenAIConfiguration`` that defines how to connect to OpenAI services.
	/// - Returns: A configured ``OpenAIContextualSession` ready for AI interactions with context injection.
	///
	/// Example:
	/// ```swift
	/// struct UserContext: PromptContextSource {
	///   let userName: String
	///   let preferences: [String]
	/// }
	///
	/// let configuration = OpenAIConfiguration.direct(apiKey: "your-api-key")
