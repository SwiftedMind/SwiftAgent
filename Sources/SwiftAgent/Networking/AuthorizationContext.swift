/// Internal, task‑local authorization context used by proxy configurations.
///
/// ``AuthorizationContext`` is an internal actor that carries the current access token for
/// a single logical unit of work, typically one agent turn. It is not meant to be used
/// directly by applications. Instead, call ``ModelSession/withAuthorization(token:refresh:perform:)``
/// which sets this context using a `@TaskLocal` value so that adapter configurations can
/// read it and attach the token to outbound requests.
///
/// Adapters like ``OpenAIConfiguration/proxy(through:)`` read this context on each request.
/// If a request returns `401 Unauthorized` and a `refreshToken` closure is available, the
/// adapter may invoke it to obtain a new token and retry once.
