import Foundation

/// Represents metadata for a URL link that can be included in prompt context.
///
/// `PromptContextLinkPreview` encapsulates information about URLs found in user input,
/// including the original URL, any final redirect destination, and extracted title metadata.
/// This data is automatically processed by ``ModelSession`` when URLs are detected in
/// conversations and can be included in AI prompts to provide additional context.
///
/// ## Integration with Prompts
///
/// When converted to prompt representation, link previews generate structured XML-like
/// tags that provide the AI with rich context about referenced URLs:
///
/// ```xml
/// <link-preview url="https://example.com/article" title="Article Title" />
/// ```
///
/// Multiple link previews are automatically wrapped in a container:
///
/// ```xml
/// <link-previews>
///   <link-preview url="https://example.com/article-1" title="First Article" />
///   <link-preview url="https://example.com/article-2" title="Second Article" />
/// </link-previews>
/// ```

	/// be a shortened URL, redirect link, or the actual destination URL.
	public var originalURL: URL

	/// The final URL after following redirects.
	///
	/// This contains the ultimate destination URL after the framework has resolved
	/// any redirects. In cases where no redirects occur, this will be identical
	/// to ``originalURL``.
	public var url: URL

	/// The title of the linked content.
	///
	/// This optional property contains the extracted title from the linked webpage's
	/// metadata (typically from the HTML `<title>` tag or Open Graph `og:title`).
	/// May be `nil` if the title could not be extracted or the URL is inaccessible.
	public var title: String?

	/// Creates a new link preview with the specified URL information and optional title.
	///
	/// - Parameter originalURL: The URL as it appeared in the original user input
	/// - Parameter url: The final URL after resolving any redirects
	/// - Parameter title: The extracted title of the linked content, if available

/// Conformance to `PromptRepresentable` for individual link previews.
///
/// This extension enables ``PromptContextLinkPreview`` objects to be directly included
/// in ``Prompt`` structures. The link preview is rendered as a self-closing XML-like tag
/// with attributes containing the URL metadata.
///
/// ## Generated Output Format
///
/// The prompt representation generates a `<link-preview>` tag with the following attributes:
/// - `url`: The final destination URL (always included)
/// - `original_url`: The original input URL (included only when different from `url`)
/// - `title`: The extracted page title (included only when available)
///
/// Example output for a redirected URL with title:
/// ```xml
/// <link-preview url="https://example.com/article"
///               original_url="https://short.ly/abc123"
///               title="Article Title" />
/// ```
///
/// Example output for a direct URL without title:
/// ```xml
/// <link-preview url="https://example.com/direct-link" />
/// ```
