/// ```swift
/// let response = try await session.respond(to: "What is 2 + 2?")
/// print("Answer: \(response.content)")
/// print("Used \(response.tokenUsage?.totalTokens ?? 0) tokens")
/// print("Added \(response.transcript.count) transcript entries")
/// ```

  /// this will be an instance of the requested `@Generable` type.
