/// The response returned by LanguageModelProvider methods, containing generated content and metadata.
///
/// ``AgentResponse`` encapsulates the result of an AI generation request, providing access to
/// the generated content, transcript entries that were added during generation, and token usage statistics.
///
/// ## Properties
///
/// - **content**: The generated content, which can be a `String` for text responses or any
///   `@Generable` type for structured responses.
/// - **transcript**: The transcript entries that were created during this generation,
///   including reasoning steps, tool calls, and the final response.
/// - **tokenUsage**: Aggregated token consumption across all internal steps (optional).
///
/// ## Example Usage
///
/// ```swift
/// let response = try await session.respond(to: "What is 2 + 2?")
/// print("Answer: \(response.content)")
/// print("Used \(response.tokenUsage?.totalTokens ?? 0) tokens")
/// print("Added \(response.transcript.count) transcript entries")
/// ```
