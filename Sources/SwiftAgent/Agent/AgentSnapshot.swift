/// A snapshot of the agent's current state during response streaming.
///
/// ## Properties
///
/// - **transcript**: The current conversation transcript with partially resolved tool runs attached
/// - **unresolvedTranscript**: The raw transcript backing the resolved projection, useful for debugging or
///   custom resolution flows
/// - **tokenUsage**: Current token usage statistics (optional, may be nil if not available)
///
/// ## Example Usage
///
/// ```swift
/// for try await snapshot in session.streamResponse(to: "What is 2 + 2?") {
///   print("Current transcript entries: \(snapshot.transcript.count)")
///   if let usage = snapshot.tokenUsage {
///     print("Tokens used so far: \(usage.totalTokens ?? 0)")
///   }
/// }
/// ```

	///

	/// including reasoning steps, tool calls, and partial responses. Tool calls are partially resolved
	/// for the observing session so that UI code can render tool output without additional resolution work.

	///
	/// Provides information about input tokens, output tokens, cached tokens, and reasoning tokens
	/// used so far during the generation. May be `nil` if the adapter doesn't provide token usage
	/// information or if no usage data has been received yet.
	public let tokenUsage: TokenUsage?

	///   - transcript: The current conversation transcript
